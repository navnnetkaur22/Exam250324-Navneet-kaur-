 There is one more site in which everything think is deeply explained that how to locate our missing files in window explorer . 

  According to me the Second site is more heplfull beacuse everything is explained straightforward and clear instructions so user cannot find any difficulities . beacuse prpoper guidence  is more important for users teaching through diagrams is the best way to learn something .
  so i will highly recommended  to gothrough this site if have problems findind file locations
